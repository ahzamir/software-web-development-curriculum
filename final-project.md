# Sneak peek: your portfolio

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
- Build a personal portfolio site.

## Description

Your portfolio website is one of the most powerful tools in your software developer toolbox; it’s the easiest way of showing what you’re truly capable of as a developer, and is a **quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of what you can bring to their teams**.

 A portfolio website is a key job searching tool for a web developer, and we want you to start working on it from the beginning of the program. 

In this project, you will **precisely replicate the portfolio template** we are providing for you. However, later on during your journey you will customize and improve it to make it more unique, as well as include more of your own projects in the portfolio.

### What makes a good portfolio website?
In essence, if you look at any of the example portfolios templates we list below, you’ll see that they each contain four shared traits:

- They are all **simple**: there’s no extraneous information, only basic background information, contact information, and a project showcase.
- They are all **visual**: they use screenshots, mockups, live demos, and other visual tools to show the viewer what you’re capable of making.
- They are all **thorough**: while the design itself may be simple, they make use of links (both in-text and otherwise) to show extra background information about their work, projects, and history.
- And they all **look good**: they use 1-3 elegant fonts, focus on 2-3 different colors, use HD images, and use color palettes that look good together.

### Portfolio templates & how to use Figma

We have provided some solid portfolio templates you can choose from. Choose the one you like the most. The templates are hosted on Figma - a collaborative UI design tool built in the browser.

Please watch the following video to learn how to use Figma and how to get the portfolio template you will be using for this project.

### Mobile first approach

Your portfolio should be prepared for different screen sizes (be responsive). You have already learned about this in [Responsive web design concepts](./responsive-web-design/12_responsive-web-design-concepts.md). However, you should be aware that in the set of following projects you will build your portfolio by using a **"mobile first" approach**.

- What is Mobile First CSS and Why Does It Rock?
    Mobile First CSS is an approach to web design where the CSS code is written to target mobile devices first, and then progressively enhanced for larger screens. It rocks because it prioritizes the mobile experience, ensuring that the website is optimized for smaller screens and slower connections.

- What is the difference between fixed, fluid, adaptive and responsive layouts and why should I care?
    - Fixed layout: The layout has a fixed width and does not change regardless of the screen size. It may result in horizontal scrolling on smaller screens.
    - Fluid layout: The layout adjusts its width proportionally to the screen size, maintaining the same proportions. It provides a more flexible and responsive design.
    - Adaptive layout: The layout has predefined breakpoints where the design adapts to different screen sizes. It provides a tailored experience for specific devices.
    - Responsive layout: The layout responds to the screen size and adapts its design accordingly. It provides a consistent user experience across different devices. You should care about these layouts to create websites that are accessible and user-friendly on various devices.

- Responsive web design (RWD) with media queries
    Responsive web design is an approach to web development that aims to create websites that respond and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries are CSS rules that apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as screen width. They allow developers to create responsive layouts and optimize the user experience on various devices.

Please, keep in mind that **the first version of your website will need to be refactored** once we ask you to build also the Desktop version.
