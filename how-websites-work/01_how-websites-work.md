## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Demonstrate a basic understanding of client-server architecture.
- Describe how URLs and DNS work.
- Explain how HTTP requests work.

## ü§î Why is it important?
Understanding how websites work is essential for anyone who wants to work with web development. It's like learning how a car engine works before you start driving. Knowing the basics of the internet and how websites are served to your browser will give you a solid foundation to build on as you dive into web development.

## üìù Description
Have you ever wondered how a website works? It's not magic, but it can seem like it if you don't know what's going on behind the scenes. In this lesson, we'll take a look at the basic architecture of the internet and how websites are served to your browser.

We'll start by explaining the client-server model, which is the foundation of the internet. Then, we'll dive into the details of how URLs and DNS work, and how they help your browser find the right server to request a webpage. Finally, we'll explore the HTTP protocol, which is the language that browsers and servers use to communicate with each other.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of the basic concepts that make the internet tick, and you'll be ready to dive into the world of web development with confidence.

## üìπ Video
Watch this short video explaining [what the Client-Server architecture is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwLdKeC8scE). Client-Server architecture is the core concept that you need to understand.

Watch the video about [different types of Client-Server architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve82kSSj_Hs) discussed in the 1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier architecture video.

Here are some additional video resources related to how websites work:

- [How DNS Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZUxoi7YNgs)
- [How HTTP Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYM2zFP3Zn0)

To sum up, watch the [How The Web Works - The Big Picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJHvdBlSxug) that connects all of this.

## ‚úÖ Challenge yourself
_Use these questions to check what you learned during this lesson._

- Can one computer play the role of client and server at the same time?
- If you are developing a website and run it in your browser, is it an example of the 1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier Client-Server architecture?
- What can identify any computer that is connected to the Web?
- Why do we need DNS servers?
- What languages and technologies can be "understood" by a browser?
