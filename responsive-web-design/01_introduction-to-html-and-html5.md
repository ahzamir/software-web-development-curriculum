## 📝 Description
>Welcome to the world of web development! HTML and HTML5 are like the building blocks of the internet. Imagine a webpage as a house, and HTML as the blueprint that tells browsers how to structure and display everything.
HTML uses special tags to mark different parts of a webpage, like headings, paragraphs, and lists. It's a bit like giving instructions to a robot (the browser) on how to arrange and present information.
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, packed with new features and improvements that make websites more interactive and dynamic. It's like getting a cool new toolset to build even fancier houses (websites).
So, if you're curious about creating your own corner of the web, learning HTML and HTML5 is where it all begins. Don't worry if it sounds intimidating at first; we're here to guide you every step of the way!
