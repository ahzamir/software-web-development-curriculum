## üìù Description
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It works together with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to make websites look and function the way they do.

HTML is used to structure the content of a web page. It uses elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images to organize and display information. HTML also allows you to add interactive features to your web pages using JavaScript.

In simple terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a web page, providing the structure and basic functionality. CSS is like the skin, determining how the page looks, and JavaScript is like the muscles, adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

_Now let's explore everything about HTML and HTML5 in detail._
