## üìù Description
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It works together with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to make websites look and function the way they do.

HTML is used to structure the content of a web page. It uses elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images to organize and display information. HTML also allows you to add interactive features to your web pages using JavaScript.

In simple terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a web page, providing the structure and basic functionality. CSS is like the skin, determining how the page looks, and JavaScript is like the muscles, adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

_Now let's explore everything about HTML and HTML5 in detail._

### HTML tags and attributes
HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets `< >` and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag is the name of the element, surrounded by angle brackets. The closing tag is the same as the opening tag, except it includes a forward slash before the element name. For example, `<h1>` is the opening tag for a heading, and `</h1>` is the closing tag.

HTML attributes provide additional information about an element. They are always included in the opening tag and are made up of a name and a value. For example, the `href` attribute in the `<a>` tag specifies the URL of the link.

### HTML elements
HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. They are made up of tags and content, and they define the structure and content of a web page. For example, the `<h1>` element is used to define the main heading of a page, and the `<p>` element is used to define a paragraph of text.

### What is Semantic HTML?
Semantic HTML is a coding style that focuses on using HTML tags based on their meaning, rather than just for appearance. For example, using the `<h1>` tag for the main heading, the `<p>` tag for paragraphs, and the `<a>` tag for links.

Why is semantic HTML important?
Semantic tags accurately describe the content on a webpage. This has several benefits:
- Easier code navigation when updating or fixing bugs.
- Improved Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to make your content more visible on search engines.
- Accessibility for users with special needs, such as screen readers for visually impaired users.
