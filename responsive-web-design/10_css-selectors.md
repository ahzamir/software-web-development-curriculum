## üìù Description
CSS selectors are used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. They allow you to target specific elements based on their tag name, class, ID, or other attributes. By using CSS selectors, you can apply styles to individual elements, groups of elements, or all elements on a page, allowing you to create visually appealing and responsive web pages.

CSS selectors consist of various types, such as element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-class selectors. Each selector type has specific syntax and behavior that allows you to target elements in different ways. By using CSS selectors effectively, you can create dynamic and responsive styles that enhance the appearance and usability of your web pages.

Understanding CSS selectors is essential for web developers, as it allows them to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. By using CSS selectors, developers can apply styles to specific elements, create responsive layouts, and customize the appearance of their web pages to meet the needs of their users.
