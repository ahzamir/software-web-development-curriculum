## üìù Description
CSS colors are used to style the elements on a web page. You can change the color of text, backgrounds, borders, and other elements using CSS. Colors can be specified using different formats, such as color names, hexadecimal values, RGB values, and HSL values.

In CSS, colors are defined using the `color` property, which allows you to set the text color, and the `background-color` property, which allows you to set the background color of an element. You can also use colors to create gradients, shadows, and other effects on a web page.

There are several types of colors commonly used in CSS:

1. Color Names: CSS provides a set of predefined color names, such as "red", "blue", "green", etc. These names can be used directly to specify colors.

2. Hexadecimal Values: Hexadecimal values are represented by a combination of six characters, ranging from 0-9 and A-F. For example, "#FF0000" represents the color red.

3. RGB Values: RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values are specified using three numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255. For example, "rgb(255, 0, 0)" represents the color red.

4. HSL Values: HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values are specified using three values. Hue represents the color itself, saturation controls the intensity of the color, and lightness controls the brightness. For example, "hsl(0, 100%, 50%)" represents the color red.

Understanding CSS colors is essential for web developers, as it allows them to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of CSS colors, including color values, color names, and how to apply colors to HTML elements.
