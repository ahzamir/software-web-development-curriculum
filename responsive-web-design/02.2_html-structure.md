## üéØ Learning Objectives
Understand the basic structure of an HTML document and the purpose of its essential components.

## üìù Description
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. To build web pages effectively, it's essential to understand the basic structure of an HTML document. In this lesson, we will explore the key components of an HTML document and their significance.

_**Now let's explore the basic structure of an HTML document.**_

- [Doctype Declaration](#doctype-declaration)
- [HTML Element](#html-element)
- [Head Section](#head-section)
- [Body Section](#body-section)
- [Header, Main, and Footer](#header-main-and-footer)
- [Heading and Paragraph Elements](#heading-and-paragraph-elements)
- [Conclusion](#conclusion)

### Doctype Declaration
The first line of an HTML document is the doctype declaration, which informs the browser about the version of HTML being used. It is written as follows:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
The declaration ensures that the browser interprets the page correctly.

### HTML Element
The HTML element serves as the root element of an HTML document. It encapsulates the entire content of the page and is represented by the `<html>` tag. It contains two main sections: the head and the body.

### Head Section
The head section of an HTML document contains meta-information about the page, such as the page title, character encoding, linked stylesheets, and scripts. It is enclosed within the `<head>` tags. Example:
```html
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
```

### Body Section
The body section is where the visible content of the web page resides. It is enclosed within the `<body>` tags. All the elements that make up the actual content of the page are placed inside the body section. Example:
```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  
  <main>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring web developer passionate about HTML and CSS.</p>
  </main>
  
  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2024 My Web Page. All rights reserved.</p>
  </footer>
</body>
```

### Header, Main, and Footer
These are semantic elements that provide structural meaning to the different sections of your web page.
- `<header>` represents the introductory content or top section of a page.
- `<main>` represents the main content area of a page.
- `<footer>` represents the footer or the bottom section of a page.

### Heading and Paragraph Elements
HTML provides various heading elements (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to define headings of different levels. Headings are used to structure and organize content. Additionally, the `<p>` element is used to define paragraphs. Example:
```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
