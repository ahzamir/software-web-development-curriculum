## üìù Description
HTML forms are used to collect user input on a web page. They allow users to enter data, such as text, numbers, and selections, and submit it to a server for processing. Forms are an essential part of web development, as they enable users to interact with websites and provide feedback or input.

HTML forms consist of various elements, such as input fields, text areas, checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons. Each element has specific attributes and properties that define its behavior and appearance. By using forms, web developers can create interactive and user-friendly websites that meet the needs of their users.

Understanding HTML forms is essential for web developers, as it allows them to create dynamic and responsive web pages that engage users and provide valuable information. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of HTML forms, including form elements, attributes, input types, and validation.
