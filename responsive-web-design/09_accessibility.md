## üìù Description
Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Accessibility is all about making your website usable by as many people as possible.

Understanding accessibility is essential for web developers, as it allows them to create websites that are inclusive and accessible to all users. By using accessibility best practices, developers can ensure that their websites are usable by people with disabilities and provide a better user experience for everyone.
