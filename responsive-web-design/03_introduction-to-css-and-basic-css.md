## üìù Description
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, appearance, and design of a web page, allowing you to style the elements on the page, such as text, images, and backgrounds.

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. You can change the font, color, size, spacing, and other properties of the elements using CSS. CSS allows you to create visually appealing and responsive web pages that look good on different devices and screen sizes.

In simple terms, HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, while CSS provides the style and appearance. Together, they create a well-designed and functional website that users can interact with.

CSS is an essential skill for web developers, as it allows them to create beautiful and user-friendly websites. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of CSS, including selectors, properties, and how to apply styles to HTML elements.
